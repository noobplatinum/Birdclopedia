#### Video Demo:  <[YT](https://youtu.be/9XTBNnywM28)>
#### Description:
Birdclopedia is a simple Flask-based web application that mainly serves as an encyclopedia for various bird species, based on their characteristics. As of now, the website features 5 main groups, namely the "Birds of Prey", "Waterbirds", "Songbirds", "Shorebirds", and "Game Birds", each with their distinctive members. The website lays out the groups in a tree structure, with each group (and their respective members) having their own descriptions, characteristics, and fun facts. The application also allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles.
The application uses SQLite for the database and Tailwind CSS for styling.
Aside from fulfilling the final project, Birdclopedia also aims to provide bird enthusiasts with a comprehensive and user-friendly platform to learn about different bird species.
